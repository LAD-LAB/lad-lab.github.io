#' @title Apply ASV Harmonization Corrections
#'
#' @description Applies the merge/rename decisions in a \code{decisions}
#'   table (typically \code{\link{plan_harmonization}}'s \code{$decisions},
#'   hand-edited as needed). Adds a \code{glom_name} column to the tax
#'   table, applies S2 rank alignment for merged pairs, physically merges
#'   ASVs where a merge was decided (transferring read counts and pruning
#'   the discarded ASV -- including through transitive merge chains, e.g. A
#'   merged into B which is itself merged into C, without losing reads
#'   regardless of processing order), and applies all chosen-name updates.
#'
#' @param ps A phyloseq object -- the same object (or the merged result of
#'   the same \code{ps_list}) that was passed to
#'   \code{\link{plan_harmonization}}.
#' @param decisions One of: the list returned by
#'   \code{\link{plan_harmonization}}; a decisions data frame (e.g.
#'   \code{plan$decisions}, possibly hand-edited); or a file path to a
#'   decisions table saved as a CSV (e.g. via
#'   \code{write.csv(plan$decisions, "decisions.csv", row.names = FALSE)}).
#'   Each row's \code{decision} column must be one of \code{"merge_keep_i"},
#'   \code{"merge_keep_j"}, \code{"keep_distinct"}, a literal ASV sequence
#'   (used when both \code{asv_i} and \code{asv_j} were merged into a
#'   third, external representative ASV -- e.g. a multi-ASV group resolved
#'   interactively, where every non-representative member points straight
#'   at one shared ASV rather than at each other), or blank (still
#'   unresolved); \code{chosen_name} and \code{rationale} are optional free
#'   text.
#' @param tax_rank_cols Character vector of formal taxonomic rank column
#'   names; inferred from \code{ps}'s tax table when \code{NULL}.
#' @param prior_outcomes Optional prior \code{apply_harmonization()} result
#'   (or its \code{$asv_outcomes} data frame, or a file path to one saved as
#'   a CSV) from an earlier round on a related object -- makes
#'   \code{$asv_outcomes} cumulative across rounds rather than starting
#'   fresh each call. Needed because \code{ps} physically loses an ASV the
#'   moment it's pruned; without this, \code{$asv_outcomes} would only ever
#'   remember the most recent round's merges, silently forgetting anything
#'   discarded in an earlier one. When supplied, this round's fresh rows are
#'   upserted onto the prior ones (this round wins for any ASV appearing in
#'   both), and every \code{merged_into} chain across the *combined* table is
#'   re-resolved so it always points at the current, ultimate representative
#'   -- e.g. if round 1 recorded A -> B and round 2 later discards B into C,
#'   A's entry is updated to A -> C rather than left pointing at the
#'   now-defunct B. See \code{\link{apply_projection}}, which consumes this
#'   cumulative ledger in place of a live reference object.
#'
#' @section Sample/taxa checkpoints:
#' If \code{decisions} carries the \code{plan_samples}/\code{plan_taxa_hashes}
#' manifest columns written by \code{\link{plan_harmonization}}, \code{ps} is
#' checked against them before anything is applied. Neither check ever
#' blocks execution -- there is no override parameter -- they only ever
#' \code{warning()}/\code{message()}: an ASV in \code{ps} the plan never saw
#' is reported (and left unchanged, since no decision exists for it; consider
#' re-running \code{plan_harmonization()} with \code{prior_decisions}); a
#' sample in \code{ps} the plan never saw is reported too, though lower risk
#' since every decision applies per-ASV regardless of which samples are
#' present (a \code{ps} with a pure *subset* of the plan's original samples
#' passes silently, just an informational message); if both checks fail at
#' once the warning escalates, recommending against trusting the output
#' without double-checking \code{ps}. Older/hand-built \code{decisions}
#' without the manifest columns, or a plan with zero flagged pairs (nothing
#' to carry the manifest on), skip both checks silently.
#'
#' @return A list with \code{ps} (the corrected phyloseq object),
#'   \code{taxtab} (its tax table as a data frame), \code{unresolved}
#'   (decision rows still blank, needing further review),
#'   \code{asv_outcomes} -- the \strong{ASV ledger}: one row per original
#'   ASV (as of \code{ps} at this call, plus anything carried forward via
#'   \code{prior_outcomes}), with its fate (\code{asv_status}:
#'   \code{"unchanged"} / \code{"representative"} / \code{"dropped after
#'   merge"} / \code{"unresolved"} -- the last meaning this ASV is part of
#'   a still-blank flagged decision, genuinely unsettled, not the same as
#'   never having been flagged at all), \code{merged_with}/\code{merged_into}
#'   (the latter always resolved to the ultimate surviving representative,
#'   through arbitrarily long chains), the \strong{full rank-by-rank
#'   taxonomy} (one column per \code{tax_rank_cols} entry -- enough for this
#'   table alone to stand in for a live reference object, e.g. in
#'   \code{\link{apply_projection}}), \code{batch_source} (derived from
#'   \code{decisions}' own \code{source_i}/\code{source_j} columns --
#'   populated only for ASVs that appear in at least one flagged pair; an
#'   ASV never flagged has no row to derive it from and stays \code{NA}),
#'   read counts, and rationale; \code{n_s2_corrected}; and \code{n_manual}.
#'   To resolve unresolved pairs manually: edit \code{decisions}'
#'   \code{decision} column and re-run.
